Student marks Prediction model.

Education is very important thing for development of a country. The main objective of every educational institutions is to give high quality education to their students. and students get well results

So every educational institute wants to know, How many hours need to do the study for each student to get above 90% marks. Then institute can determine the performance of the student.. One way to fulfill this, by predicting student's academic performance and thereby taking early steps to improve student's performance and teaching quality. That's why ML engineer developed this Student marks prediction model.

Student marks prediction is a well liked data science case study based on the problem of regression. It is a good regression problem, who want to start career in data science and it is easy to solve and understand. So if you want to learn how to predict student mark with machine learning algorithms, this project is for you. In this project, I will take you through the task of student marks prediction with machine learning algorithms using Python.
